<h3>What Is Console Screen And Why Is It Used</h3>
<h4>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, 
the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.
It is used for testing purposes before you print anything on your web page</h4>
